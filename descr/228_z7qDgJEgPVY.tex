A family of Poncelet 3-periodics (blue) is shown interscribed between two generic nested ellipses. Recall the incenter X1 is where the internal bisectors concur. The excentral triangle (solid green) is bounded by the external bisectors of the 3-periodic. Its vertices are known as the excenters. 

The video shows the loci of both the incenter and the excenters (solid green, and dashed green, respectively). Notice the former bounds a convex region while the latter doesn't.
