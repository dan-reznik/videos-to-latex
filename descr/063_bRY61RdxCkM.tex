Consider the family of 3-periodics in an Elliptic Billiard with axes a,b [1]. Let each triangular 3-periodic be defined by vertices P1,P2,P3, where P1(t) = [a cos(t), b sin(t)], t=[0,2Ï€) is used as a parametrization. 

Take a Kimberling Center [2] Xi, and consider the family of lines defined by [P1(t),Xi(t)].

The video shows the envelope [3] of such a family for various Xi, i=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10,11,12,20, over a/b=[1.,2).

Notable cases include:

a) P1X1: the evolute [4] of the billiard boundary. as these are always parallel to the normal at P1
b) P1X5: spiderman? why does it explote?

More info in [5].

Note: the lower right animation of X(20) is incorrectly showing X(12). To be corrected.
