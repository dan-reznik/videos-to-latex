A circumparabola is the isogonal image of a tangent to the circumcircle. If you hold that tangent fixed, you can observe the family of circumparabolas induced by a poncelet family inscribed in a fixed circumcircle. The video shows that the locus of the focus, vertex, and directrix "center" are high-degree curves over Poncelet families with a caustic which is (i) a concentric inellipse, (ii) the Brocard inellipse.

Amazingly, the locus of the focus is a *straight line* if the family under consideration is Chapple's porism, i.e., N=3 bicentric triangles (caustic is a circle).
