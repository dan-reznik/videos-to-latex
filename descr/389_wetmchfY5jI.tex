Take an ellipse E with semiaxes a,b. Let P(t) = [a cos(t), b sin(t)] be a point on E, t in [0,2pi]. Let M be a fixed point on M's boundary.

The envelope of lines L(t) passing through P(t) and perpendicular to P(t)-M is a deltoid (3-cusps) and its area is the same for all M on E [1].

The video shows said envelopes for a/b=1.125, Sqrt[2], and the golden ratio (left, mid, right). For each case the dynamically invariant area A is shown at the top.

Also shown is the center of area of the deltoid, which appears to move along an elliptic path (dashed red). For comparison, a 90-degree rotated copy of the ellipse is also shown (dashed black). Numerically the former is always exterior to the latter.

Notice when a/b=Sqrt[2], the focal length is unity and one of the deltoid cusps passes through the center of E.
