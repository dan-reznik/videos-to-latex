Amazing geometric phenomenon, discovered experimentally.

The mittenpunkt (where lines from each excenter to its corresponding median meet) of all triangular orbits in an elliptic billiard is STATIONARY at the billiard's center.

The triangle point which led to this amazing May 7th, 2019 discovery was identified in 1836 by Christian Heinrich von Nagel as the symmedian point of the excentral triangle. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mittenpunkt
