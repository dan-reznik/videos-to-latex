Six a/b=1.5 elliptic billiards are shown (black), drawn to the same scale. Each billiard is shown with its family of N=3,4,....8, non-intersecting orbits (blue).

Also shown are T' the orbits' excentral (tangential) polygons (solid green). It turns out the intersection of segment (i,i+1) in T' with the reflection of segment (i+1,i+2) about the origin sweeps out circular loci (red). 

Because of the relationship with to Monge's Orthoptic Circles and the Poncelet-Darboux "grid" of loci of edge-edge intersections, we call these stationary objects Monge-Darboux Circles in homage to the great French Mathematicians Gaspard Monge (1746â€“1818), and Jean-Gaston Darboux (1842-1917).
