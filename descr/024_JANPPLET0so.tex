Given an ellipse (a,b) (black) two Poncelet porisms can be set up for 2 families of 3-periodics (red and green triangles) of fixed circumcircle (and equal circumradius) such that E is their common caustic and their Brocard points (and their midpoint X39) are common and stationary. Also stationary for each family are X3, X6 and X182 (wrongly labeled X186 on video), the latter the center of the respective Brocard circles (shown dashed red and green).

It does take two to tango!
