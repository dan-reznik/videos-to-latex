The Poristic Triangle family is shown (blue) with fixed incircle (green) and circumcircle (purple). Let r,R represent the radius and circumradius. In this case, r/R=0.36266. Also shown are the Excentral Triangles (green) and the locus (orange) of its vertices: this is a circle centered on X40 and of radius 2R.

Two derived ellipses are shown:

1) green: C1 = The X1-centered circumconic to the poristic triangles. Its semiaxes are *invariant* over the family at R+d, and R-d, where d=Sqrt[R(R-2r)], i.e., C1 is a fixed ellipse rotating around X1.

2) red: I3' = The X40-centered Inconic to the Excentral Triangles (i.e., centered on the latter's circumcenter). Its semiaxes are *also* invariant and equal to R-d and R+d. I.e., this is a fixed ellipse rotating around X40.

The main result: C1 is a 90-degree rotated copy of I3'.
