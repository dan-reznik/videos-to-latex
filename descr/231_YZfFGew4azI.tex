The family of hexagonal (N=6) orbits is shown in an elliptic billiard. The black dot drawn at the origin corresponds to the stationary position of the vertex, perimeter, and area centroids of all orbits. The triangle formed by vertices 1,3,5 is shown shaded, and the location (and locus) of its major triangular centers is also shown, revealing elliptical paths.
