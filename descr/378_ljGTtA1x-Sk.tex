The trees are in their autumn beauty,
The woodland paths are dry,
Under the October twilight the water
Mirrors a still sky;
Upon the brimming water among the stones
Are nine-and-fifty swans.
[...]
But now they drift on the still water,
Mysterious, beautiful;
Among what rushes will they build,
By what lake's edge or pool
Delight men's eyes when I awake some day
To find they have flown away? --W. B. Yeats

The video shows the family of Poncelet 3-periodics (blue) in an elliptic billiard (black). Triangle centers X(88) and X(162), imagined as swooning swans, execute a remarkable ``dance´´ on the boundary of an elliptic ``pond´´. Though both swans swim along the entire Billiard, neither moves monotonically, nor do they ever cross each other. For details see [1]. For a live animation see https://bit.ly/3f6M9Wh
