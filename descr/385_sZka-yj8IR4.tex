The video shows a family of equilateral triangles P1P2P3 whose sides are dynamically tangent to an ellipse with a/b=3.5. Also shown are:

a) red: the locus of the vertices (red, the 60-degree isoptic [1])
b) brown: the non-conic locus of the centroid "G" (anyone care to derive it?)
c) dashed green: the astroid-like envelope of the bisectors ("E" marks the instantaneous center of rotation)

An interesting geometric phenomenon is that (b) and (c) are tangent in four non-trivial locations, and G and E coincide thereon. This suggests there are four configurations where the triangle turns about its center.
