This experiment was inspired by [1].

Shown is the family of self-intersected 5-periodics (blue) in the Elliptic Billiard E (black). Let Pi denote its vertices. The focus-inversive polygon (pink) has vertices Pi' at the inversions of the Pi wrt unit circle (dashed black) centered on a focus f1 of E. Turns out this new family has invariant perimeter and sum of cosines, for all N.

On a previous video [2] we showed that the loci of C0,C1,C2 (vertex, perimeter, and area centroids) of the non-intersected focus-inversive family were circles. Turns out this property holds for self-intersected N-periodics as well!

Santé!
