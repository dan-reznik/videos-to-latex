Consider the family of N-periodics in the Elliptic Billiard. Let Pi, i=1,...,N be its vertices. Its antipedal polygon w/ respect to a point M has sides which pass through the Pi and are perpendicular to the lines Pi-M.

Let the antipedal vertices with respect to f1 be called Q_{1,i}, and with respect to f2 be called Q_{2,i}.

This (narrated) video shows that the sum of distances from f1 to the the antipedal vertices wrt f1 is the same as the sum of distances from f2 to the antipedal vertices wrt to f2. This is invariant k_{603} in [1].
