Family of N=4 orbits of an a/b=1.5 elliptic billiardare. For each orbit the locus of the barycenter X(2), incenter X(1), orthocenter X(4), and mittenpunkt X(9) are shown for one subtriangle formed by three consecutive orbit vertices as as well as its (rectangular) tangential polygon as well as the (circular) locus (Monge's orthoptic) of its vertices.
