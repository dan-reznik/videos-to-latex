The video shows the property-rich family of self-intersected 4-periodics in the elliptic billiard. A few of the properties covered:

a) constant perimeter
b) vertices concyclic with foci. this implies the inversive polygon with respect to a focus degenerates to a segment;
b.1) [not shown]: power of the center wrt to circumcircle is constant.
c) side midpoints are collinear on horizontal line. their locus is an 8-shaped curve
d) the vertices of the "excentral polygon" are also concyclic with the foci.
d.1) the power of the center with respect to the excentral circumcircle is also constant and equal to b.1.
