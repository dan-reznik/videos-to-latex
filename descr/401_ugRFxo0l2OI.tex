The famly of non-intersecting N=5 (pentagonal) orbits (blue) for an a/b=1.5 elliptical billiard (black) is shown. For each orbit its excentral polygon (green) is drawn, as well as the elliptic locus of its vertices (dashed green). The latter's foci are the green dots on the x axis. Also dhown is the confocal caustic (green ellipse) to the orbits. Consider dropping a perpendicular from each excentral vertex to its corresponding orbit side. Each will be congruent with the touchpoints of that side with the caustic, and their locus will be caustic. The red points are intersections of said perpendiculars, taken two consecutive ones at a time. For N=5 they form a 5-gon which alternates between convex and concave. Any of its vertices will trace out the 4-petal flower drawn.
