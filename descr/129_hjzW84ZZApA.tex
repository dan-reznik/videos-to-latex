This experiment was inspired by [1].

Take the family of N-periodics (blue) in the Elliptic Billiard E (black), let Pi denote its vertices. In the video N=5. The corresponding focus-inversive polygon (pink) has vertices Pi' at the inversions of the Pi wrt unit circle (dashed black) centered on a focus of E, e.g., the left one. Turns out this new family has invariant perimeter and sum of cosines, for all N.

The video shows a curious effect. Let C0,C1,C2 denote the vertex, perimeter, and area centroids of the focus-inversive family. Turns out for all N, their loci are all circles (pink) with centers lying on E's major axis!

Santé!
