Consider Poncelet 3-periodics in the confocal pair (aka, elliptic billiard, top left) and its affine image which sends the caustic to a circle (incircle family, bottom left, rotated to fit). It turns out both families have identical, constant r/R, i.e., identical invariant sum of cosines. Therefore in cosine space (right), their cosines vectors (c1,c2,c3) sweep planar curves, resembling guitar "picks". Surprisingly, over both families, the two curves swept by confocal ("C") and incircle ("I") are identical (though out of phase). The video shows the guitar pick curves swept for various ratios of a/b in the confocal pair.
