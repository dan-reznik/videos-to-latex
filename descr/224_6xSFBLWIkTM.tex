Shown (left) is a 1d family of 3-Periodics interscribed in a pair of ellipses as well as (right) their affine image such that the outer ellipse is sent to (the complex) circle. The vertices of the original family (Pi) are sent to a triple of complex numbers z1, z2, z3. A parametrization described in [1] is used by us to arrive at several results concerning loci of triangle centers [2].
