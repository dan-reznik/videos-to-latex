An a/b=1.5 elliptic billiard is shown as well as its family of 3-periodic trajectories. The billiard is reflected at every bounce point so that the entire trajectory is shown as a (constant lenght L) straight line P1 to P1''. Here the starting vertex P1 is pinned to the origin as is the vector normal at that point, which is "pinned" at the vertical direction. This makes the locus of the endpoint P1'' be an arc of a circle. Loci are drawn for a few intermediate points.
