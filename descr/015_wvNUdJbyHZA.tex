Consider the N=3 porism of "bicentric triangles", aka, Chapple's porism. These are triangles ABC inscribed in an outer circle C=(O,R) and circumscribing an inner circle C'=(I,r).

Now consider an ellipse E with foci on (I,A), constrained to pass thru O.

The video shows that over the porism, the locus of the two covertices of E is a marvellous circle.
