Family of self-intersected 4-periodic orbits (blue) and tangent polygon (green) shown in an Elliptic Billiard (black) with a/b=2. Also shown are (i) the confocal hyperbolic Caustic (red), (ii) the symmetric orbit (dashed red), tangent to the Caustic at its vertices, and (iii) the "wedge'' orbit (dashed blue), which touches the EB' s top vertex (the path is doubled-up as it traverses itself twice).
