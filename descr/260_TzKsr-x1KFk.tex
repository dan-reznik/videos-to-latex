Shown are 6 families of N-periodics in a pair of concentric, homothetic ellipses, for N=3,4,5,6,7,8. Without loss of generality, the outer ellipses have a/b=1.3. Invariant quantities include (i) area A, (ii) sum of squared sidelengths s_i^2, (iii) sum of internal angle cotangents, and (iv) sum of squared cotagents, except for N=4.

How 'bout that?
