Consider the family of triangles T(t)=V1V2P(t) inscribed in an ellipse E with axes a,b. Namely, V1,V2 are fixed on the boundary of E and P(t) executes one revolution along it.

The video shows the loci of triangle centers X2,X3,X4,X5 of T(t) [1] which are all ellipses (except X3 which is a segment). Specifically, we can observe how these loci change over parallel V1V2 (P(t) is not shown).

What is observed is that as V1V2 is translated, the loci also translate. Interestingly, the motion of their center is a line (magenta) which passes thru the center of E.
