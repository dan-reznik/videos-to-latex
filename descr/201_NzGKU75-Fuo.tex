Point X(144) is known to be the perspector of the extouch and anticomplementary triangles. For any triangle, lines connecting corresponding vertices will also pass through the intouch triangle of the anticomplementary. What is newly verified for the case of billiards, is that the latter's vertices coincide with the billiard.

We would like to call X(144) the "Darboux Point" in homage to the great French geometer Jean-Gaston Darboux (1842-1917)
