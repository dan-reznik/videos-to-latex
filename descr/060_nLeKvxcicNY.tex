Consider the family of triangles T(t)=V1V2P(t) inscribed in an ellipse E with axes a,b. Namely, V1,V2 are fixed on the boundary of E and P(t), not shown, executes one revolution along it. Consider the locus of a a point X a fixed linear combination of the barycenter X2 and orthocenter X4, i.e.:

X = X2 + (X4-X2) ρ

The video shows an intriguing result: only if V1V2 is either horizontal or vertical can said locus be a circles. Specifically, two values of ρ for each configuration accomplish this.
