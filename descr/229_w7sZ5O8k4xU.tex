Shown is the family of Poncelet 3-periodics (blue) interscribed between an outer ellipse and an inner non-concentric circle. The elliptic loci of X3 and X5 are shown. Notice the major axes of said loci contain the center of the circular caustic, a conjecture appearing in [1]. Also shown are the 3-periodics' (moving) circumcircle and Euler circle.
