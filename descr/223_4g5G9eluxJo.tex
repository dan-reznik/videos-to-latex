Consider an elliptic billiard with semiaxes a,b and its family of 3-periodics. 

When a/b≈2.81652, the locus of X(140), the midpoint of X(3) and X(5) [1], is a perfect *circle* of radius ≈0.59282.

When a/b is less (resp. more) than that threshold, the locus if a wide (resp. tall) ellipse. 

No other triangle center reviewed so far has been found to produce a perfectly circular locus when a/b is *not* 1. Indeed, several triangle centers do describe circle or point loci when the billiard itself is a circle. So X(140) is very unusual and could be unique.

For more of our own research on the topic see [2].
