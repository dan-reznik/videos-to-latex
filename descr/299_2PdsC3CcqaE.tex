Consider the 1d family of Poncelet N-periodics inscribed in an external ellipse E=(a,b) and circumscribed about an internal ellipse E'=(a',b') which is concentric and homothetic to E. Without loss of generality, the video depicts (a,b)=(2,1) and N=5.

The following are invariants recently detected for this family.

a) area
b) sum of sidelengths squared
c) sum of cotangents

note: sum of the squares and cubes of cotangents are also constant [1].

The following are new ones:

d) sum of distances from focus to the vertices (elementary for even N)
e) sum of square distances from any point P0 on the plane (internal or external to E)
