An a/b=1.5 Elliptic Billiard (EB). is shown (blue) as well as the 1d family of 3-periodic orbits (blue, filled gray). Also drawn are the orbit's Anticomplementary Triangle (ACT, blue) and Medial Triangle (red).

The ACT circubmilliard (CB, blue) is an ellipse (blue) centered on the ACT Mittenpunkt X7 (anticomplement of X9) inside which the ACT is a billiard orbit. The ACT is homothetic (double-scale and flipped) to the orbit, so its CB is twice the size of the EB, and their axes are parallel.

The ACT's Incircle (blue) passes through the ACT's Intouchpoints. Surprisingly, these lie dynamically on the EB. The ACT Incenter is X8 (anticomplement of X1 not shown). X9,X2,X7 are collinear.

The Medial Triangle (red) is formed by the sides midpoints. It is also homothetic to the orbit (half-scale and flipped) so its CB will be half the size of the EB and their axes will be parallel. The Medial CB is centered on X142, the complement of X9. One can regard the orbit as the Medial's ACT, therefore the latter's Incircle (green) will have Intouchpoints which lie on the Medial EB. X142, X2 and X9 are collinear.

Also shown is the line connecting X_i, i=7,142,2,9,144. Their consecutive distances are proportional to 3:1:2:6. X144 was included since it is the perspector of the ACT and its Intouch Triangle.
