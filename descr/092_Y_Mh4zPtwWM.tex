This video explores the locus of the vertex V of inparabolas to a generic circle-inscribed Poncelet family of triangles with focus on a fixed point F on the circumcircle.

Recall classically known facts (thanks to Liliana Gheorghe for letting us know). The Simson line of triangle wrt a point F is tangent to the inparabola w focus F at its vertex V. Therefore the latter is the projection of F on the Simson line.

We show that:

a) over Poncelet, for fixed F, the locus of V is a circle
b) over all F, the locus of the center of (a) is an ellipse
c) over Poncelet, the envelope of Simson lines is a point W which is the reflection of F on the center of (a).
d) Over all F, the locus of W in (c) is an ellipse concentric with the inconic.
