Shown is an a/b=1.5 elliptic billiard and its family of N=3 (triangular) orbits. Also shown are the billiard's excentral (green) and anticomplementary (blue) triangles.

The isogonal conjugate of the billiard is the orbit's antiorthic axis, shown as a green line. Equivalently, the billiard's isogonal conjugate is the trilinear polar of X1, the perspector of the orbit and its excentral.

The isotomic conjugate of the billiard, shown blue, is the Gergonne line (L55) of its anticomplementary triangle. Equivalently, the billiard's isotomic conjugate is the trilinear polar of X144, the perspector of the the orbit's anticomplementary triangle and the latter's contact triangle (shown dashed blue).
