Consider the family of 3-periodics in an Elliptic Billiard with aspect ratio a/b. The envelope of its sides is a confocal caustic. The video shows the envelope of the sides 16 well-known derived triangles, as the aspect ratio is varied. Equivalently, shown is the envelope of the line family defined by two consecutive vertices of a derived triangle.
