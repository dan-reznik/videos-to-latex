An Elliptic Billiard (a/b=1.5) is shown (black) as well as the family of non-intersecting pentagonal (N=5) orbits (blue). For each orbit the Tangential Polygon is shown (green). Its vertices intersections of tangents at consecutive orbit's vertices. The locus of these vertices is the dashed green a non-confocal ellipse (its foci are the green dots on the x axis). 

The feet of perpendiculars dropped from each tangential vertex to the corresponding side is congruent with the point of tangency of that side with the confocal caustic, i.e., the locus of these feet is the caustic.

Also drawn is the (red) polygon connecting the feet of the aforementioned perpendiculars. This polygon is a projective dual to the original orbit.
