An a/b=1.5 Elliptic Billiard is shown (black) as well as its family of 3-periodics (blue). 

Left: the X(3)-centered inconics (purple) are a family of ellipses. When the 3-periodic is acute (resp. obtuse), the inconic is interior (resp. exterior) to its reference triangle (blue). At the top the instantaneous value of its two semi-axes is shown, as well as their variable ratio. Also shown is the perspector P=X(69) [1] of the inconic where cevians which connect the original vertices to the contact points (red dots) concur. The locus of the contact points (orange) is a self-intersecting curve (sextic?). 

Right the X(3)-centered inconics (purple) of 3-periodics' Excentral Triangles (green). Since the latter are acute, X(3) (or X(40) in reference triangle terms) and the inconic family is always internal.  Shown at the top is the invariant ratio of semiaxes (aspect ratio). Cevians (dashed green) are shown concurring at the perspector P=X(69) of excentral=X(2951) of reference triangle [1]. Also shown is the locus (orange) of contact points (red dots).
