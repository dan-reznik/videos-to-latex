Consider the family of 3-periodics (blue) with vertices P1,P2,P3 in the elliptic billiard with foci f1 and f2. Let the "focal" hyperbola (red) be defined dynamically by the quintuple (P1,P2,P3,f1,f2). The locus of the hyperbola center (red dot) is an ellipse (dashed red).

Consider a cartesian system with origin on the center of the elliptic billiard and x,y axis along its major and minor axis. Consider the following 5-parameter implicit for a general conic:

cxx x^2 + cyy y^2 + cxy x y + cx x + cy y + 1 = 0

where cxx,cyy,cxy,cx,cy are (variable) coefficients.

Surprisingly, over the hyperbola family, cxx and cyy are non-zero and invariant and cx = 0. The only varying parameters are cxy and cy.
