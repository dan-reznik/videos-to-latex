Shown are Elliptic Billiard families of two types of self-intersected 6-periodics (blue); these are tangent to hyperbolic confocal caustics (green). Note that both families conserve their perimeter and sum of cosines.

Also shown are their inversive polygons (pink), whose vertices are inversions of the original ones with respect to a unit-circle centered on the left focus. Concerning the inversive polygon:

1) In both cases the perimeter is invariant.

2) Only the left case conserves the sum of cosines. We think this could have something to do with the fact that both 6-periodic and the inversive have zero signed area.
