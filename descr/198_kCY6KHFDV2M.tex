We consider families of triangles T=P1P2P3 inscribed in a fixe outer ellipse E (black) with two sides tangent to an internal confocal ellipse E', which smoothly traverses the family of confocals. In each instant we show a snapshot of T as well as the complete locus of the incenter X1. When E,E' are such that 3-periodics with all sides tangent to E' are possible, the locus of X1 is an ellipse. However, at other settings of E', the locus is a 3-loop self-intersected curve.
