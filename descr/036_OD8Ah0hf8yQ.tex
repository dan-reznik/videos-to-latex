The three excenters of the family of 3-periodic orbits in elliptic billiards describe the same elliptic locus. Shown is the locus of the convex combination of one excenter with its corresponding extouch point (where the excircle touches a side), which happens to also be elliptic and congruent with the caustic.  Apparently, and unlike other convex combinations (barycenter and median, orthocenter and altitude foot, incenter and contact point), in this case all intermediate loci are elliptic.
