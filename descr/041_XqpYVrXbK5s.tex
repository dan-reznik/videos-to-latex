Consider the 1d family of Poncelet 5-periodics interscribed in a pair of non-concentric, non-aligned nested ellipses. Let Pi, i=1,...,5 be the vertices. Consider the following "diagonals" (i) P1P3, (ii) P1P4, and (iii) a "cross bar" diagonal P2 P5. Let four collinear points ABCD be defined as follows:

ABCD = P2, intersect(iii,i), intersect(iii,ii), P5.

The video explores the cross ratio of ABCD (or of 5 other orderings thereof).

Allow for ABCD to be defined as above, but with respect to any "starting" vertex Pi in the trajectory, i.e., some Pi takes the "role" of P1.

We show that under certain orderings, and over the 5-periodic family, the sum of cross ratios (wrt to each of the Pi), and/or the product of cross ratios, can be conserved
