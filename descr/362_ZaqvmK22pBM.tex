An a/b=1.15 elliptic billiard is shown (black) as well as its family of N=5 self-intersecting (pentagram) orbits (blue). Also shown are the latter's 5 points of self-intersection (forming a pentagon), their elliptic locus (purple), and the caustic (green).

Notice the pentagon of self intersections *is* a billiard orbit of its the locus of its vertices, which is an ellipse.
