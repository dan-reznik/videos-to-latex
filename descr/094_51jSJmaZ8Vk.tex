In this video we consider circumparabolas to a fixed equilateral triangle T which are isogonal images of a line tangent to the circumcircle at a point Q. We show that:

a) the locus of the focus is a non-intersecting 3-branched infinite curve
b) the envelope of the directrix is a 3-branch infinite curve w 3 self-intersections
b) the circumcenter of the polar triangle is collinear with the circumcenter of T and Q (this is only true if T is equilateral)
c) the locus of X4 of the polar of T wrt to the circumparabolas coincides with (b)

We also showcase several loci of several other triangle centers of the polar triangle. The locus of X99 is a 3-leaf clover which is tangent to (a). At a special location o Q on the circumcircle, X99 coincides with the focus of the associated circumparabola.
