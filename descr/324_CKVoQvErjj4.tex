Consider the 1d family of Poncelet 3-periodics inscribed in an ellipse and circumscribed about a concentric circle (green). Consider its affine image such that the two aforementioned conics are sent to a pair of confocal ellipses (red).

It turns out both families have invariant and identical sums of cosines.
