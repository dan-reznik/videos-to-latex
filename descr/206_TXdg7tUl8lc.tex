a/b=1.5 elliptic billiard shown as well as its family of N=3 orbits. Also shown are the X(1)-centered incircle (green), X(5)-centered nine-point circle (pink), and their point of contact, the Feuerbach point X(11). Also shown the X(100), the anticomplement of X(11), i.e., the Feuerbach point of the orbit's anticomplementary triangle. Equivalently, twice the reflection of X(11) about X(2). Not shown: X(9) lies stationary at the center of the billiard!
