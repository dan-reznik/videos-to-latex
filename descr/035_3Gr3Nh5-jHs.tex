Elliptic loci of the barycenter (top) and incenter (bottom) for the family of 3-periodic orbits in an elliptic billiard is shown as solid curves. Dashed curves represent the convex combination of the former with a side's midpoint (respectively, an intouch/contact point). Notice how a perfectly elliptic locus deforms into one containing 3 windings, seemingly of 6th order.
