Consider the outer polygon (green) to 8-periodics (blue) in the elliptic billiard (black). These have sides tangent to the billiard at the N-periodic vertices.

We have shown elsewhere that the sum of double cosines of the outer polygon is invariant for all N. The video shows that for the special N=8 case, this sum is also equal to ZERO! In fact one find that c'(i) = -c'(i+2), where the c'(i) denote the double cosine at the ith vertex of the outer polygon. 

Note: we have also shown elsewhere that for N even the product of outer to N-periodic areas is invariant.
