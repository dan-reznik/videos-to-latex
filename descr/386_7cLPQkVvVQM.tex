The 1d family of 90-60-30 right triangles (blue) enveloping and a/b=3.5 ellipse (black) is shown. The locus of each of the vertices is shown blue and corresponds to the 90-, 60-, 30-isoptics of the ellipse [1], i.e., the outer component of certain quartics. Recall the 90-degree isoptic, i.e., the ellipse "orthoptic" is a circle known as Monge's circle. Also shown are the loci of triangle centers in sequence, from X(1) to X(20).
