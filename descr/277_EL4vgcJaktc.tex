An ellipse E is shown (a/b=1.5) as well as its foci. A point P is shown moving continously along E's boundary. Also shown is the locus of tangent points from P to the continuous family of ellipses confocal with E. For each such confocal, two tangents are defined, giving rise to the two branches (blue, yellow) of the locus.  When P is at the left or right (resp. top and bottom) vertices of E, the locus becomes circular (resp. circular arc).
