Hey welcome to my 2nd narrated video about properties of 3-periodics in the Elliptic Billiard. This one reviews our early observations concerning:

a) classic billiard invariants: perimeter and the confocal caustic. 
b) stationarity of the Mittenpunkt X9
c) invariant r/R ratio of inradius to circumradius.
d) invariant ratio A'/A of excentral and 3-periodic areas
e) invariant product and area ratios of pedal and antipedal triangles of X9 with respect to 3-periodics, and their corollaries.
