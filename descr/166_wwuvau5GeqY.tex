An a/b=1.5 elliptic billiard is shown along with its family of N=3 (triangular) orbits. For each orbit 3 equilaterals are erected on its sides (green). The sequence of the latter centroids produces the "outer napoleon equilateral" (shown purple).

The following loci are shown:

- dashed green: the apparently (but non-) elliptic locus of their outer vertices is shown dashed green
- dashed blue: the non-elliptic locus of the side medians, above which the altitudes of the side equilaterals are erected. - 
- dashed purple: the non-elliptic locus of the vertices of the central outer napoleon equilateral.
- solid purple: the elliptic locus of the central equilateral's centroid.
