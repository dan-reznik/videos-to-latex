Take any 6 points on the plane P1,...P6, and define 3 diagonals cyclically:

d1=(P1,P3), d2=(P1,P4), d3=(P2,P6).

Let A,B,C,D denote P2, intersect(d1,d3), intersect(d2,d3), and P6, respectively.

Claim, the cyclic product of cross ratios [AC;BD], for i=1,...6 is independent of the Pi and equal to 1.

Note: this property works for any even-sided polygon, with N greater than 5 (to be shown in upcoming video).
