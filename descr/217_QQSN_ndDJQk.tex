One can successfully build a Poncelet 3-periodic family interscribed between two concentric, axis-parallel ellipses which will maintain X(k), k = 1,2,3,4,6,9 stationary at the common center. Notice all of these are on the Thomson Cubic [1].

This video introduces a new ellipse pair, this time centered on X(1249), also on the Thomson [2]. The video shows that the perspector of the circumconic is X(4), and that of the inconic (the Brianchon point) is X(20).

Because X(1249) is on the Thomson, the normals to the circumconic concur. Intersestingly, the also concur at X(20). The normals to the inconic at the contact points also concur. We are grateful to B. Gibert for calculating the latter to be at X(1498).
