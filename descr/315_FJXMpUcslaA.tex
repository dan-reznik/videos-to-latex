The family of Poncelet 3-periodics (blue) is shown interscribed between two concentric, non-axis aligned ellipses. Three circumellipses are shown centered on the vertices of the anticevian triangle (green) with respect to the common center. The video shows that even in this configuration, the sum total of circumellipse areas is invariant.
