Consider the family of 3-periodics in an Elliptic Billiard (EB) with  aspect ratio a/b. 

The following is shown while a/b is varied from 1.1 to 3.5 in steps of 0.01:

a) dark gray (the billiard)
b) orange: locus of orbits' orthocenter
c) green: locus of orbits' orthic triangle's incenter. note that when this curve is detached from the orthocenter (orange), the orbit is obtuse
d) blue: the orthic's orthocenter
e) red: the orthic's orthic's incenter. note that when this curve is detached from [d], the orthic triangle is obtuse.
