Consider the family of Poncelet 3-periodics interscribed between an outer ellipse w semi-axes (a,b) and an inner unit circle.

Recall Cayley's condition for the existence of 3-periodics in a pair of concentric, axis aligned ellipses with semi-axes (a,b) and (a',b'): a'/a+b'/b=1. Since in this case a'=b'=1, then the following must hold:

 that 1/a + 1/b = 1

The video shows said family and the fact that its circumradius R is constant. Since the inradius r by definition is as well, the sum of cosines = 1+r/R is also invariant.

By definition, the incenter X1 is stationary at the common center. The locus of the circumcenter X3 is a concentric circle, i.e., the distance |X3-X1| is invariant.
