Consider a N=4 Poncelet family of polygons (orange) interscribed between two nested circles, called here the N=4 bicentric family. We have shown recently this family conserves sum of cosines and the perimeter of pedal polygons wrt to either one of its limiting points [1].

Consider the family of pedal polygons of the bicentrics wrt to a generic point P0 in the plane. The video shows that if P0 lies on the line perpendicular to Oint and Oext and passing thru l2, the area of the bicentric pedal wrt to P0 is dynamically zero.
