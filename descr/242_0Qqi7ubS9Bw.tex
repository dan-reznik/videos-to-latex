Consider an elliptic billiard w/ the following reflection rule: at every bounce proceed perpendicular to the previous segment. These are known to be integrable [1].

In this video I manually stumble upon a few periodic trajectories which emerge from such a reflection rule, some displaying quite beautiful geometry.
