If you take the N=3 family of elliptic billiard trajectories T (blue triangles, X9 stationary at billiard center), and invert the vertices with respect a unit-radius circle (dashed black) centered on one of the foci, you get a new "focus-inversive" triangles T' (pink). 

The T' is inscribed a Pascal Lima√ßon (classical result, the focus-inversive image of the billiard ellipse).

Surprisingly,  the T', like their parents T, display invariant perimeter and invariant sum of cosines. Their mittenpunkt X9' describe a circular locus whereas their Gergonne point X7' is stationary!

Also drawn is the moving circumellipse (orange) of T' centered on X9', which we call a "circumbilliard". The lengths a',b' of its semiaxes' id also invariant. I.e., the T' are a billiard family with respect to this rigidly rotating family of ellipses.
