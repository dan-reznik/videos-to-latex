Left: a 5-periodic Poncelet family between concentric ellipse (external, black) and circle (internal, purple). Steiner's Curvature Centroid K is also shown (average of vertices weighted by sine of double angles). Amazingly, its locus is circular (dashed green)! Also shown is the pedal polygon (orange) of the 5-periodic with respect to (the moving) K. Amazingly, the ratio of its area by the 5-periodic's is invariant over the family! (this only holds if N is odd).

Right: a 5-periodic Poncelet family where the external conic is a circle (black) and the internal one is a concentric ellipse (purple). For this system, Steiner's Curvature Centroid K is stationary at the center! Also shown is the pedal polygon of the 5-periodic with respect to (the moving) K. As before, the ratio of its area by the 5-periodic's is invariant over the family! (again, this only holds if N is odd).
