An a/b=1.5 elliptic billiard is shown as well as its family of 3-periodic trajectories. The billiard is reflected at every bounce point so that the entire trajectory is shown as a (constant lenght L) straight line P1 to P1''. Here the starting vertex P1 is pinned to the origin and P1'' vertically above it. Since L is constant, P1'' is fixed. Loci are drawn for intermediate trajectory vertices.

Curious property: despite all asymmetries, the locus of the circumcenter of the P3P1'P2'' triangle (filled in light yellow) is a horizontal segment (purple).

Proof by Mark Helman, Jan 4, 2020: let A, B, C, D are arbitrary points on a line. Let FE,EG pass through B,C, respectively. Circumcenter of EFG will fall on the bisector of segment AD.
