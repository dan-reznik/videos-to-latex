This is the 12th and final video on this experimental series. Here we explore myriad phenomena associated with P-antipedal triangles to a family of rotating equilaterals, including loci of their vertices and their triangle centers. P can be anywhere on the plane or on one of the main circles associated with the reference family. Said phenomena are also analyzed upon affine transformations of the base family.
