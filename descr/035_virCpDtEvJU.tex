The video shows Poncelet 3-periodics in a pair of ellipses in "general position", namely,  the inner one need not be concentric nor axis-aligned with the outer one. Given the outer ellipse, we demonstrate how a numeric optimizer can be used to obtain the appropriate parameters for the inner ellipse such that the error associated with the Cayley condition vanishes.
