Both ellipses shown have a/b=1.5.

Left: 3-periodics (blue) in the Elliptic Billiard (EB, black). Recall these have stationary Mittenpunkt X9, and that X100 lies at the intersection of the circumcircle with the X9-centered circumellipse, i.e., the EB. Over the family of 3-periodics, the envelope of Simson lines (red) with respect o X100 is an astroid-like curve (purple). The envelope of lines (dashed red) passing through X100 and perpendicular to the aforementioned Simson family is a "cushion shaped" curve (purple) w four cusps, tangent to the EB at the four vertices. Also shown is the EB's evolute (dashed black).

Right: the N=3 poncelet family (blue) inscribed in their Steiner Ellipse (a,b) semiaxes and centered on X2, with the Steiner Inellipse (a/b,b/2) as their caustic has constant area. Recall X99 lies at the intersection of the Steiner Ellipse with the Circumcircle. Over this family, the envelope of Simson lines (red) with respect o X100 is also an astroid-like curve (purple). The envelope of lines (dashed red) passing through X99 and perpendicular to the aforementioned Simson family is also a "cushion shaped" curve (purple) w four cusps, tangent to the EB at the four vertices. Also shown is the EB's evolute (dashed black).
