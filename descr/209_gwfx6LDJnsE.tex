Family of N=3 orbits shown for a/b=1.5 elliptic billiard. Two phenomena are shown:

- the 3 vertices of contact triangle of orbit's anticomplementary triangle lie on the billiard.
- the anticomplementary's circumbilliard is axis aligned with the billiard and its center is, as usual, its mittenpunkt, which is congruent with the orbit's Gergonne point X(7) (i.e., the gergonne is the orbit's mittenpunkt -- the origin -- reflected about the baricenter at twice the distance, which is where the Gergonne point lies, collinear with M and B).

Note: D (we call the "Darboux" point, X144) is the perspector between the anticomplementary and contact triangles (and the orbit's extouch triangle, extouch pts shown green on caustic). It is also the anticomplement (with respect to the baricenter) of the Gergonne point, X7. Notice D, M, B, and the Gergonne, are collinear.
