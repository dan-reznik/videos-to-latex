An elliptic billiard (x/a)^2+y^2=1 is drawn in black, a = 1.5. The family of triangular orbits (P1,P2,P3), at starting P1(t)=(a cos(t),sin(t)) is shown, as well as the orbit's circumcenter, baricenter, nine-point-circle-center, and orthocenter (these 4 on the euler line). Shon as well are  wel as the incenter and the feuerbach center (single point the incircle (green) touches the 9-point-circle (pink). feuerbach is found by shooting an-inradius-long ray from the incenter along the 9-point-to-incenter line. the locus of the feuerbach over all orbits is shown below as the dashed ellipse, which seems to be internally tangent to all orbits.
