GPU-based interactive viz of regions of convergence and divergence of the circumcenter map [1]. 

In Mathematica computing these can take several minutes and/or hrs and even days.

In contrast, a modern GPU can compute dozens of frames per second, allowing for total interactivity: regions get distorted as one drags around vertices of the starting polygon (N=3,4,5...).

The regions can also be colored by area expansion or contraction and/or rotation after N applications of the map. Lines of neutral scaling or rotation can be visualized as well as their intersections.
