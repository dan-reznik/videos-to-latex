Consider a fixed a=2, b=1 ellipse (black), and the family of N=3 poncelet caustics (billiard or non), gray, (a0,b0). The Cayley condition states that a0/a + b0/b = 1. The animation sweeps b0 from 0.05 to 0.95. For each such caustic, a particular N=3 polygon is shown as well as the loci formed by a few triangular centers.
