Shown is the family of self-intersected 7-periodics (blue) in an a/b=2.0 elliptic billiard (black). Notice 7-periodic segments are tangent to a confocal elliptic caustic (brown). The latter's major semi-axes are obtained as the root of a degree-12 polynomial [1].

Also shown are the the "focus-inversive" polygons (pink) whose vettices are inversions of the 7-periodic ones wrt to a unit circle centered on the left (resp. right) focus. These are inscribed in separate Pascal Lima√ßons. Invariants for the inversive polygons:

a) perimeter
b) sums of cosines 
c) product of areas!
