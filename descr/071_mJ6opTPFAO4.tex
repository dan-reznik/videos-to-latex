This is a continuation of the previous video.

Let M be a point on the boundary of an ellipse E. Let n be the ellipse normal at M.  Let Q1 and Q2 be the intersections of tow rays shot from M, along rays r1 and r2 (blue in the video), which are copies of n rotated by β+α and β-α. 

Before we sawo that when α=90, for fixed M, and over all β, the envelope of Q1Q2 is a point, known as the Frégier point [2]

The video shows the envelope of Q1Q2 for various combinations of fixed α,β, but over all M on E. These can contain cusps, stationary points, or be regular.
