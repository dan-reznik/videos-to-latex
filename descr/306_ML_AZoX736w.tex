Left: 1d family of 3-periodic Poncelet triangles inscribed in an outer ellipse and circumscribing an inner, concentric circle. It turns out (i) the locus of the family's circumcenter X3 is a concentric circle, (ii) it conserves circumradius R, and (iii) it conserves the sum of cosines and product of half sines.

Right: since d=|X3-X1| is fixed, said family is equivalent to the family of Poristic triangles, i.e., 3-periodic Poncelet triangles of fixed inradius and circumradius [1]. To see this consider the original family with respect to a moving reference frame centered on X1 and with one axis in the X1X3 direction.

Since Poristics have been shown to be the image of 3-periodics in the elliptic Billiard under a varying affine transform [2], i.e., all scale-free invariants valid for the EB (see [3]) will be valid here as well.
