An elliptic billiard with a/b=1.5 is shown. The family of N=4 self-intersecting "bowtie" orbits (blue) is shown for all valid starting positions on the top boundary. Also shown are two branches of the confocal hyperbolic caustics (green) to which every orbit is tangent. A dotted inverted V is shown depicting the position in which the N=4 orbit contains two coinciding branches (double orbit).

Observation 1: it turns out if a/b is smaller than sqrt(2) no self-intersecting N=4 are possible. 

Observation 2: this orbit conserves the sum of its internal cosines (in the case of N=4 non-self-intersecting this value is trivially zero).
