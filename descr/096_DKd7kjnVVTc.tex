The video explores the family of circumparabolas to Poncelet triangles in the "homothetic family". Circumparabolas are constructed as isotomic images of a line L tangent to the Steiner of the family. The video shows that (i)  all circumparabolas remain tangent to a reflection of L about the common center, and (ii) that the locus of the focus, vertex, and "center" of the directrix are curves of high degree.

Thanks to Bernard Gibert for pointing out that the focus locus is of degree 9.
