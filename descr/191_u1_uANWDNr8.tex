Consider a family of triangles P1P2P3 inscribed in an outer circle C (black), with P1P2 (resp. P1P3) tangent to a 1st (resp. 2nd) inner circular caustic C', brown (resp. C'', dashed brown). The last side, P2P3 will, by virtue of Poncelet's Closure Theorem, envelop yet a 3rd inner circular caustic C''' (dashed red).

There are four ways to choose the side of the 1st and 2nd caustic P1P2 and P1P3 will be tangent to. Interestingly, over the four choices, P2P3 will envelop only two distinct 3rd caustics C'''.

The video shows all choices superposed. In the left (resp. right) one can see the four distinct loci traced out by the symmedian point X6 (resp. Nagel point X8). Note: two of the X6 loci look fused, but there are actually 4 distinct ones.
