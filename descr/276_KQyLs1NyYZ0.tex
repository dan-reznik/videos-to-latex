Video shows 12 distinct (blue) Poncelet 5-gons (blue) inscribed to an outer circle (black) w sides tangent to 4 internal in-pencl circles (orange).

Also shown is their polar image (light blue polygon) with respect to the pencil's internal limiting point (l1, red). These are billiard trajectories between multiple confocal ellipses, all of which are tangent to the innermost one (since vertices of the original N-gon are inscribed to a circle). Their (signed) perimeter is constant (reflections are counted positive and refractions negative).

The exotic result shown here is that all 12 distinct polar images have the *same* signed perimeter!
