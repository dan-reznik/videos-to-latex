This is a continuation of [1]. Consider a concentric pair of ellipses and its associated 3-periodic poncelet family. Consider the 3 circumellipses E1,E2,R3 of T centered on the vertices of T', the anticevian [2] of T with respect to the common center. The video shows (experimentally) that the sum of areas of the three said circumellipses is constant for the four pairs shown (confocal, with-incircle, with-circumcircle, homothetic).
