An a/b=1.5 elliptic billiard is shown (black) with its family of N=3 (triangular) orbits (blue) and the caustic (brown). The Miquel point of the orbit triangle, using the three extouchpoints is computed (point of concurrence of 3 circles) as well as its upright elliptic locus. This point appears to be X(40).
