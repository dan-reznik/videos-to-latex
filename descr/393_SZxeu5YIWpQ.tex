This is probably a classical result, but interesting nonetheless.

Take a triangle T=ABC and a point M on its plane. Define 3 subtriangles by joining M consecutive vertices:

Ta = MBC, Tb = MCA, Tc = MAB

Let T4={X4a, X4b, X4c} be the triangle of the orthocenters of Ta,Tb,Tc.

Claim: the area of T4 is equal to that of T irrespective of M.
