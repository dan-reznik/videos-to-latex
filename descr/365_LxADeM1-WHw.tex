We explore a slew of interesting properties and invariants of a special envelope of lines discovered by Prof. Ronaldo Garcia [1] which we have baptized the "Steiner's Hat", as it is related to Steiner's Dekltoid [4].

Take an ellipse E with semiaxes (a,b). Let M be a fixed point on E, and P(t) = [a cos(t), b sin(t)], t in [0,2pi] be a parametric point also on E.

The family of lines L(t) passing through P(t) and perpendicular to P(t)-M envelops, also known as the negative pedal curve or orthocaustic to the ellipse, is a 3-cuspid deltoid. Surpisingly its area is invariant over all M [1].

The 3 preimages of the deltoid cusp's on E form a triangle with barycenter stationary at E's center, and whose area is also invariant. Therefore E is its Steiner Circumellipse. The caustic to this family is its Steiner Inellipse, i.e., of axes (a/2,b/2).

However, Steiner's hat is different from Steiner's! :^)

Note: during the video I will occasionally and mistakenly call the ellipse a "billiard". Just disregard that. This geometry shown here is unrelated to Elliptic Billiards.
