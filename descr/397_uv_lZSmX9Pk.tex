An a/b=2.5 elliptic billiard is shown (black) as well as its family of 3-periodics (blue). As these rotate, triangle centers X(88) and X(162) execute a remarkable dance on the boundary of the Billiard. Tough both cover the entire Billiard, neither move monotonically, nor do they ever cross each other.
