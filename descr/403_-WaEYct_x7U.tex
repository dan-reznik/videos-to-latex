The video shows a family of equilateral triangles P1P2P3 whose sides are dynamically tangent to an ellipse with a/b=2.5 (left) and a/b=3.5 (right). Also shown is the locus of the vertices (the outer component of a quartic -- the 60-degree isoptic curve, see [1]) and the non-conic locus of the centroid G. Anyone care to derive what this curve is?
