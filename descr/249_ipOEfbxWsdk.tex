Consider an elliptic billiard (black) with semiaxes a,b and the family of N-periodics (blue). Let P(i), i=1,2,...N denote its vertices and f1,f2 its foci.  Also shown is the confocal caustic (brown).

Consider N subtriangles Ti=[P(i),P(i+1),f1] which together tesselate the N-periodic. Let Ri (resp. ri) denote the circumradius (resp. inradius) of Ti.

Experimental claim: the ratio of the sum(Ri) by the sum(ri) is invariant for all N.

Any help proving this is appreciated!
