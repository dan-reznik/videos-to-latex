An ellipse E is shown (a/b=1.5) as well as its foci. A point P is shown moving continously in the neighborhood of E's right vertex V. Also shown is the locus of tangent points from P to the continuous family of ellipses confocal with E. For each such confocal, two tangents are defined, giving rise to the two branches (blue, yellow) of the locus.  In the region traversed by P the locus undergoes a phase transition from a complex curve (when P is below V) to perfectly circular (when P is at V)  to a mirrorerd complex curve (when P is above V).
