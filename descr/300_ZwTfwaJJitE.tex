Consider the family of Poncelet 3-periodics between a concentric homothetic ellipse pair: an outer elipse w semi-axes (a,1) and an inner one w semi-axes (a/2, 1/2). The video shows a pair w a=3 (left) and a=5 (right).

Experimentally, we have found that an exact 32 out of the first 200 Triangle Centers listed on ETC [1], produce elliptic loci under the 3-periodic family, to be sure:

Xi, i= 3, 4, 5, 6, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20, 32, 39, 61, 62, 69, 76, 83, 98, 99, 114, 115, 140, 141, 147, 148, 182, 187, 190, 193, 194.

Remarkably, the loci of centers Xj, j=13,14,15,16 are circles (these are the centers features on the video). In fact, the radii of said loci (w/ the exception of X16), grow monotonically with a. X16 radius is non-monotonic and hits a minimum of 4 at a=3.

Note:

X(13) = 1st ISOGONIC CENTER (FERMAT POINT, TORRICELLI POINT)
X(14) = 2nd ISOGONIC CENTER
X(15) = 1st ISODYNAMIC POINT
X(16) = 2nd ISODYNAMIC POINT
