This is not a Wicca video! We are actually describing interesting cross-ratio [1] related invariants manifested by over the Poncelet family of bicentric 5-gons (simple or self-intersected) [2]. Cross-ratios are measured on four collinear points obtained from certain diagonal (or chordal) arrangements between vertices in the trajectory. We show that the sum and product of cyclically-defined cross ratios are simultaneously invariant for 4 out 6 labeling of the collinear points.

Maybe this is a Wicca video after all...
