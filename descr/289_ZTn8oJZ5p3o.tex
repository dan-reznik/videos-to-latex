The video shows a Poncelet N=6 family (blue) inscribed in an outer circle D  (black), with sides tangent to three internal circles D1, D2, D3 (orange), such that C,D1,D2,D3 are in the same pencil. The internal limiting point l2 is also drawn.  This family is automatically closing in the same sense the N=4 family is, see [1].

Also shown is the polar image (light blue)of the N=4 family with respect to limiting point l1. This family has a dynamically null signed perimeter (refracted rays count negative) though its area is variable.
