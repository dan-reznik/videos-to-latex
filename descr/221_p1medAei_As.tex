Shown is the family of Poncelet 3-periodics (blue) interscribed between two non-concentric, unaligned ellipses, as well as the elliptic loci of Xk, k=2,3,4,5,20. A few remarks from [1]:

a) The condition for the locus of a triangle center to be an ellipse is that it is a fixed linear combination of X2 and X3, i.e., it will lie on the Euler Line (dashed gray).

b) the centers of the ellipses are collinear (magenta line). 

c) The loci of both X2 and X4 are always axis aligned with the outer ellipse.
