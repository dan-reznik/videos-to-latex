Video shows concentric, axis-aligned ellipse pairs and N-periodic Poncelet families.  The left (resp. right) animations are of 5- (resp. 6-) periodics.

a) top row: outer ellipse, inner circle. invariants here include sum of cosines, product of half-sines (odd N) area-over-perimeter, product-of-sidelengths-over-perimeter, etc.

b) bottom row: outer circle, inner ellipse. invariants here include product of cosines, sum of squared sidelengths, etc.

In the top row, "K" is the Steiner Curvature Centroid (a generalization of the circumcenter for N=3), obtained as the weighted average of vertices, where weights are the sine of double angles. Interestingly, for N odd (resp. even) its locus is circular (resp. a point).

In the bottom row, "pX4" is the pseudo-Orthocenter (a generalization of the orthocenter for N=3), obtained as the weighted average of vertices, where weights are the tangent of the angles. Interestingly, for N odd (resp. even) its locus is circular (resp. a point).
