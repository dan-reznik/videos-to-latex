Take an ellipse E with semiaxes a,b. Let P(t) = [a cos(t), b sin(t)] be a point on E, t in [0,2pi]. Let M be a fixed point on M's boundary.

The envelope of lines L(t) passing through P(t) and perpendicular to P(t)-M is a deltoid and its area is the same for all M on E [1].

The video shows said deltoidal envelop for a=1.5, b=1. The dynamically-computed area A is shown at the top.

Also shown is the center of area of the deltoid, which appears to move along an elliptic path (dashed red). For comparison, a 90-degree rotated copy of the ellipse is also shown (dashed black). Numerically the former is always exterior to the latter, no matter what a/b is.

Note: when a/b=Sqrt[2], one of its cusps passes through the center of E (show on a sister video [2]).
