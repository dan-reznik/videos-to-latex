Joint work w Ronaldo Garcia.

Show is a the family of type I self-intersected 8-periodics (blue) in the elliptic billiard (black) (for type II see [1]). All trajectory segments are tangent to a confocal hyperbolic caustic (brown).

Also shown is the constant-perimeter inversive polygon (pink), where the inversion is wrt unit circle centered on left focus.
