T (blue) is a reference triangle w/ vertices ABC, where AB is on the x axis and C is made to move along a straight line above AB. Shown in red is T's orthic triangle Th (red), and the latter's excentral triangle Te (green). Note that the excentral triangle is always acute. Note also that if T is acute, the excentral of its orthic will be T itself. But when T is obtuse, (1) two of Th's vertices will be outside of T, and (2) Te will be the acute triangle ABH, where H (shown orange) is the orthocenter of T.
