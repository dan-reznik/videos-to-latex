If you take the N=3 family of elliptic billiard trajectories T (blue triangles, X9 stationary at billiard center. Let its vertices be denoted Pi. Perform an inversion of the Pi with respect a unit-radius circle (dashed black) centered on one of the foci (say left, f1) to get a new "focus-inversive" triangles T' (pink) w vertices Pi'. 

White the Pi are inscribed in an ellipse, the Pi' are inscribed in a Pascal Lima√ßon (classical result, the focus-inversive image of the billiard ellipse).

Let r_i (resp. r_i') be the distance |Pi-f1| (resp. |P_i'-f1). By construction r_i'=1/r_i. It turns out the sum of the r_i' is invariant! The r_i (resp. r_i') focal "spokes" are shown dashed (resp. solid) blue.

Also, the T', like its parent T, displays invariant perimeter and invariant sum of cosines. Their mittenpunkt X9' describe a circular locus whereas their Gergonne point X7' is stationary!

Also drawn is the moving circumellipse (orange) of T' centered on X9', which we call a "circumbilliard". The lengths a',b' of its semiaxes' id also invariant. I.e., the T' are a billiard family with respect to this rigidly rotating family of ellipses.
