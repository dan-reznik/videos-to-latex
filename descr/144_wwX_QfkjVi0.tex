This is the 3rd part of a series of videos investigating properties of inversions of the excenters of elliptic billiard 3-periodics [1,2]. One first observation is that no matter what the inversion center is, the Symmedian point X6 of the inversive family is stationary.

We have shown previously that the cosine circle [3] of 3-periodic excentrals was stationary [4]. This video shows that the cosine circle of the inversive families also is!
