Shown are the loci of isogonal conjugates X(11) and X(59) over a Poncelet family of triangles P1P2P3 inscribed in a fixed outer ellipse, with two sides P1P2 and P1P3 (blue) tangent to an internal concentric circle (brown) of smoothly changing radius. The envelope of P2P3 (not shown) is, according to Poncelet's general theorem, an ellipse in the pencil of E and E'.

Notice the mesmerizing topological changes to both loci. From larvae to chrysalis to butterfly and vice-versa!
