Consider a concentric pair of ellipses where the outer has semiaxes (a,b), and the inner (a0,b0), such that b0=(a^2 b)/(a^2+b^2), a0=b0*(b/a). This pair admits a 3-periodic Poncelet family w/ the remarkable property that X4 is stationary at the common center. 

Additionally, the locus of X107 (resp. X122) is identical to the outer (resp. inner) ellipse.
