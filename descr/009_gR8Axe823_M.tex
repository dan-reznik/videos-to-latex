Top left: a generic concave curve C (black) is shown as well as its curvature centroid K. A point M is shown lying on a circle (dashed black) centered on K. Also shown are the pedal Cc (red) and contrapedal Cp (green) curves of C with respect to M. These are animated for varying positions of M on the circle centered on K. Notice their areas Ap and Ac are invariant.

Top right: the interpolated pedal curve Cμ (blue) for μ=1/4 . Cμ = (1-μ)Cp + μ Cc. Surprisingly, its area Aμ is also invariant for M on a circle centered on K.

Bottom left: μ=1/2. Here Cμ will be homothetic to C (at a scale of 1/2) and its area is independent of the location of M.

Bottom right: Cμ is shown for μ=3/4, isocurves of invariant Aμ are as before, circles centered on K.

These facts are proven in [1].
