An a/b=1.5 Elliptic Billiard is shown as well as its family of  3-periodics (blue) and their caustic (brown). A copy of the latter (reflected about the Billiard Center) is also shown (dashed blue). The [P1, -P2] family of lines (red) is instantaneous tangent (at "C") to a non-confocal elliptic caustic (green). Note [P1,-P2] is vertical/horizontal at when the 3-periodics are isosceles, suggesting a simple method to compute the axis of the (green) caustic.
