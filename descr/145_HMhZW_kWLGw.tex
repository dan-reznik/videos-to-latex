Show in the family of 6-periodics (blue) in the a/b=2 elliptic billiard.

1) The inversive polygon (pink) wrt to the left focus (f1) has invariant perimeter and it is inscribed in a Pascal Limaçon (dashed pink). This invariance holds for all N and a/b.

2) The antipedal polygon (olive green) of the N-periodics wrt f1 at this choice of N and aspect ratio (6 and 2 respectively) has zero signed-area. Its locus is a fish curve with 3 self-intersections (dashed olive green).

3) The vertices of the pedal polygon of the inversive wrt f1 (orange) has a cusped limaçon-like locus (dashed orange).

Not shown: the pedal polygons of N-periodics wrt to f1: this family is interscribed within a pair of non-concentric circles, see [1].
