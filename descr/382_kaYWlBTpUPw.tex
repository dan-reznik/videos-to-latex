The famiy of N=3,4,5,6 orbits are shown in separate elliptic billiards (all with a/b=1.5). Also shown are their excentral polygons, whose vertices are intersections of tangent lines at consecutive orbit vertices. We noticed these trace out elliptic loci non-confocal with the billiard (green dots are foci of the loci). For N=3, the locus is an upright ellipse, being horizontal for all others. As N grows, the loci foci approach the billiard's.
