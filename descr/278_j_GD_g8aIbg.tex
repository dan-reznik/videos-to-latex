Elliptic Billiards and their N periodics!

Consider the "pedal polygon" defined by the feet of perpendiculars dropped from a point m in the plane onto the sides of P', the polygon tangent to an N-periodic.

The video investigates what happens to c0' and c2', the vertex and area centroids of P'.

In particular, for N even, these are stationary over the family.

If m is on the major (resp. minor axes), these lie on the same axis.

At N=4, if m is on a focus, something really neat happens: c0' is at the midpoint between the center and the focus, whereas c2' is one-third of the way across.
