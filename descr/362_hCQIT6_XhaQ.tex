Family of N=3 orbits in an a/b=1.5 elliptic billiard. For each orbit T its excentral triangle T' is shown in green. Also shown is T'', a copy of T' reflected about its symmedian point, congruent with the orbit's stationary Mittenpunkt X(9). T' and T'' intersect in 6 points, the locus of which is, suprisingly, a stationary CIRCLE, centered on the Mittenpunkt and whose radius is that of the cosine circle [1] of T', as shown, slight bigger than the billiard's major semiaxes. Also shown is a point P on the orbit, and its reflection P' about the center of the billiard, which is also on the billiard. It turns the corresponding edge of T'' grazes the billiard at P', and this is true for all reflected orbit vertices and the corresponding edge of the reflected excentral triangle.
