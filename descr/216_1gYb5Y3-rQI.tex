The Feuerbach point (shown as brown "F") is the tangency point between the incircle and the 9-point circle (not shown). The extouch points (green, t12, t23, t31) are the tangency points between each excenter and its corresponding side. All these four points describe an elliptic locus which is internally caustic to the orbits
