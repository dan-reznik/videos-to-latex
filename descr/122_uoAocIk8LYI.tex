Let T' be a triangle (dashed red) whose vertices are inversions of those of a reference triangle T (solid red) with respect to a circle C (solid green) centered on O.

Let X6 (resp. X6') be the symmedian point of T (resp. T').

The fact that O,X6,X6' are collinear is known.

The video shows that if O follows a circle (dashed green) centered on X6, then X6' follows another concentric circle (dashed red).
