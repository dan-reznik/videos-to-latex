Shown in gray: elliptic billiard (a=1.5, b=1), and (dashed) the family of pentagonal orbits (N=5), with each vertex identified: ABCDE.

Shown in red: an "upright" version of ABCDE, where A is "pinned" to (0,1) and its bisector is fixed to the vertical. Vertices of this "normalized" pentagon are shown A', B', etc. The barycenter of this pentagon is labeled G. Also shown are the loci of the four "free" vertices of the normalized pentagon, as well as that of G.
