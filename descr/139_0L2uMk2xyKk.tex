Given the family of N-periodics (blue) in the Elliptic Billiard, let P1 (resp. P2) denote the "inversive" polygon (pink) whose vertices are the N-periodic vertices inverted wrt to a circle centered in the left (resp. right) focus. These are each inscribed in a Pascal's Lima√ßon (olive green). Their perimeters and sum of cosines are invariant. In another video we show the product of their areas A1.A2  is invariant for odd N only.

In this video we show a phenomenon peculiar to N=3: the pedal polygons (orange) of P1,P2 w respect to each focus, though non-congruent, have the same (though variable) area over the family.
