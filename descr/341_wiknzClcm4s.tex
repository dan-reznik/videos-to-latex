We investigate the locus of the circumcenter X3, orthocenter X4, and 9-pt-center X5 of antipedal triangles over a rotating family of equilaterals with respect to a fixed point P. We show all are conics and the conic type depends on the position of P chiefly with respect to the incircle and the Spieker circle of the family.
