The video explores the dynamic geometry and conservations in a Poncelet porism whose vertices are the centers of circles in a Steiner chain with N circles. This family is the polar image of the harmonic family with respect to its circumcircle. One of the main observations is that the sum of tangents of half angles to the power of k, with k less than N is conserved. See [1,2,3].
