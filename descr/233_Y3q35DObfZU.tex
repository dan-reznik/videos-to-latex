Four identical a/b=1.5 elliptic billiards are shown (black), as well as the family of N=3,4,5,6 orbits (blue). Within each orbit one notices a (brown) caustic -- this is a virtual ellipse, confocal with the billiard, which is internally tangent to the corresponding family.  Orbits within a family have constant perimeter. Equivalent to tangency of edges to the caustic is the conservation of angular momentum.
