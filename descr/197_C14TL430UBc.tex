Top left: 3-periodics in the confocal pair C and C' (black and brown ellipses). The locus of the incenter X1 is an ellipse (green).

Top right (resp. bottom left): Sides P1P2 and P1P3 are kept tangent to an inner confocal caustic slightly smaller (resp. larger) than the N=3 one. The envelope of P2P3 (dashed red) is an ellipse in the pencil of C and C', though on-confocal with them. The locus of X1 is now a self-intersected curve.

Bottom right: for this particular caustic choice, the envelope of P2P3 is a point at the common center. It turns out this is the caustic required for billiard 4-periodics. The locus of X1 is a wiggly thingy.
