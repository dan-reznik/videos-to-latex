Top row: 

a) left, poristic, or bicentrics (bic-I): triangles inscribed in an outer circle (black) and an enveloping an inner one (brown)
b) middle (bic-II): triangles inscribed in an outer circle (black) with two sides are tangent to a first circular caustic (brown) and third one envelops a 2nd, in-pencil circle (dashed red)
c) right (bic-III):  triangles inscribed in an outer circle (black) with one side tangent to a first circular caustic (brown), and a second one tangent to a second in-pencil circular caustic (dashed brown). The third side automatically envelops a 3rd, in-pencil circle (dashed red).

Bottom row:

a) left, confocal family aka. elliptic billiard (conf-I): triangles inscribed in an outer ellipse which circumscribe an inner, confocal one. perimeter is constant.
b) middle (conf-II): triangles inscribed in an outer ellipse with two sides tangent to an confocal first caustic (brown). The third side automatically envelops an in-pencil, non-confocal 2nd caustic (dashed red).
c) right (conf-III): triangles inscribed in an outer ellipse with one sides tangent to a first  confocal first caustic (brown), while a second side is tangent to a second, in-pencil, non-confocal 2nd caustic (dashed brown).  The third side automatically envelops an in-pencil, non-confocal 3nd caustic (dashed red).
