X(40), also known as the Bevan Point [1] is the center of the circumcircle (dashed green) to the excentral triangle (solid green).

The locus of X(40) under the 3-periodic family in the Elliptic Billiard is known to be an ellipse similar to a rotated copy of the Billiard. If the latter has axes a,b, the former will have axes a'=c^2/a and b'=c^2/b where c^2 = (a^2-b^2) [2]

These relations imply that b' = a ⇔ a/b = (1+Sqrt[5])/2 = ϕ = golden ratio. I.e., at this aspect ratio the locus of X(40) is magically a rotated copy of the original Billiard. Stay tuned, as more properties may arise!
