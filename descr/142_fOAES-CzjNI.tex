An a/b=2 elliptic billiard is shown (black) as well as its 6-Periodic family (blue). Also shown is the family's inversive (pink) and antipedal polygons (green) wrt to the left focus. These two polygons are "duals" of each other [1].

We have shown elsewhere [2] that for all N, the perimeter of the inversive polygon is invariant.

The video shows that for this special choice of a/b and N, the signed area of the antipedal is dynamically zero.

For no other choice of N and billiard aspect ratio have we been able to (experimentally) zero the area of the antipedal over the N-periodic family.
