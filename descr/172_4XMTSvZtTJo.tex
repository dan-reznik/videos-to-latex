An a/b=1.618 Elliptic Billiard (EB) is shown (black) as well as its family of 3-periodics (blue triangles). Also shown are the Excircles (green) centered on the vertices of the Excentral Triangle (green). The elliptic locus of the Excenters [1] is shown dashed green. Excircles touch the 3-periodic at three "Exouchpoints". Extensions of 3-periodic sides (dashed purple) are tangent to the Excircles at 6 points; these form a 6-gon (purple). The video shows the locus of alternate vertices of said 6-gon, each forming a bean-shaped curve (red and dashed red). Also shown is the (non-constant) area and perimeter of the tangents' hexagon.

Also shown (dashed purple) is the locus of two consecutive points on the hexagon. These have been numerically found to be a perfect ellipse whose aspect ratio is identical to the EB's.
