"The symmedian point X6 is one of the crown jewels of modern geometry" (R. Honsberger, cited in [1]). Indeed, this triangle center is chock-full of surprises. Here we describe yet another one now in relation to a certain Poncelet family.

This is a continuation of [2], where we showed that over the family of excentral 3-periodics in the elliptic billiard, inversions of the vertices wrt to unit circles centered on (i) common center, (ii) billiard focus, (iii) outer ellipse focus, produced new "inversive" triangle families whose symmedian point X6 is mysteriously stationary. Following an idea by Mark Helman, the video shows that if the inversive family is computed wrt to a circle centered anywhere, the symmedian remains stationary!
