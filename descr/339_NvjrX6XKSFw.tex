These two systems are related by a similarity transformation [1].

Left: An R=1, d=.5241 poristic triangle family (blue): stationary Incircle (green) and Circumcircle (purple). Also shown are (i) the Excentral Triangles (green) and the circular locus of the Excenters (orange); (ii) the Caustic to the Excentral Triangles (red) is the (stationary) MacBeath Inconic (red); (iii) the MacBeath Circumconic (olive green) to the Excentrals; (iv) the Circumbilliard: an X9-centered circumconic to the poristic family which renders the latter a 3-periodic.

Right: an a/b=1.5 elliptic billiard (black) and its 3-periodic family (blue). Moving Incircle (green) and Circumcircle (purple) are shown. Also shown are (i) the Excentral Triangles (green) and the Ellliptic locus of the Excenters (olive green), which is its (stationary) MacBeath Circumellipse; (ii) the Inconic to  the Excentral Triangles centered on their X5 (X3 of the 3-periodics); (iii) the moving Circumcircle (orange) of the Excentrals.

If we compare both systems we notice:
