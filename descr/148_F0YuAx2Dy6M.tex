Consider the family of excentral triangles T' derived from 3-periodics in the elliptic billiard. This is a family of acute triangles. Its sides will be tangent to the billiard at the vertices (since bisectors to 3-periodics are parallel to ellipse normals at the vertices). Its symmedian point X6 will be stationary since it coincides with the (stationary) mittenpunkt X9 of the reference 3-periodics [3,4]. Furthermore, the locus of its vertices will be an ellipse E' [1].

The video shows that if you invert the T' family wrt a unit circle centered on

(i) the common center
(ii) a focus of the elliptic billiard (caustic to the excentrals)
(iii) a focus of the ellipse E' to which the excentrals are inscribed

Their individual symmedians X6 will also be stationary.
