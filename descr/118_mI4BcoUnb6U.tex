Consider a family of triangles T=ABC (blue) rigidly rotating about a point P in the plane. Now consider a family T' (red) with vertices at the inversions of A,B,C with respect to an inversion circle (dashed green) centered at an arbitrary point O. The video illustrates a few observations. Let X(k) [resp. X'(k)] denote the kth triangle center of T [resp. T'].

1) For any choice of O, if P=X(6) of T, then (i) O,X(6),X'(6) are collinear, and (ii) X'(6) is stationary
.2) For any choice of P,O, the locus of X'(6), i.e., the X(6) of T', is always an *ellipse* with minor axis along OP.

Note: P need not be a triangle center of T, it can be any point in the plane.

Related phenomena happen with X'(k), k=3,15,16,61,62,187, to be described in subsequent videos.
