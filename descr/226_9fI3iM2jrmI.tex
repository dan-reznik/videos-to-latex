Shown is an a/b=1.5 elliptic billiard with its family of N=4 (quadrangular orbits). These are known to be perfect parallelograms. Also known is the fact that their tangential (excentral) polygon is a rectangle and the locus of the latter's vertices is circular. This is known as Monge's Orthoptic Circle and/or Monge's Theorem, after French Mathematician Gaspar Monge (1746-1818).
