The focus-inversive family (pink) is obtained by performing inversions of 3-periodic (blue) vertices in the elliptic billiard (black) with respect to a unit-circle (dashed black) centered on a focus. Suprisingly, the focus-inversive family has invariant perimeter and some of cosines. Furthermore, its Gergonne point X(7) is stationary.

The video shows the suprisingly circular loci of the focus-inversive X(k), k=1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 20, 21, 35, 36, 40, 46, 55, 56, 57, 63, 65, 72, 78, 79, 80, 84, 90, 100. The plot label shows their radii.

What gives?
