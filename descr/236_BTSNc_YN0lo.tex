Shown is the family of non-intersecting 4-periodic orbits in the elliptic billiard (they are all parallelograms!), a/b=1.5, as well as its excentral quadrangle, formed by the intersection of the lines tangent to the ellipse at consecutive  orbit vertices (a perfect rectangle). Not shown is the locus of the rectangle vertices: a perfect circle, known as Monge's Orthoptic Circle. Similar to the mittenpunkt X(9) for triangular orbits, a middlespoint at the origin can be constructed by drawing a line from each of the exquadrangles' vertices (virtual "excenters") through the the median of the corresponding orbit edge. Nice!
