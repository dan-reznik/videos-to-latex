The poristic triangle family (blue) is shown with fixed incircle (green) and circumcircle (purple). A circumellipse, called the "Circumbilliard", is shown (black) for which the poristic triangle a 3-periodic billiard trajectory. Also shown is the locus of X9 (red), the center of the CB, known to be a circle [1]. Also circular is the locus of the CB's foci (cyan), recently discovered [2].

Soundtrack: Villa-Lobos, Choros No 1.
