Consider the family of N-periodics (blue) in the Elliptic Billiard (confocal ellipse pair). The video shows the N=5 family in an a/b=1.61803 ellipse (black).

Let P1 (resp. P2) be an "inversive" polygon (pink) whose vertices are N-periodic vertices inverted wrt to a circle centered in the left (resp. right) focus. These are each inscribed in a Pascal's Lima√ßon (olive green).

It turns out the product of their areas A1.A2 is invariant over the family, for odd N only.
