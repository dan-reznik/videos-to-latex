The power circles of a triangle are centered on sides' midpoints and pass thru the opposing vertex [1].

The video shows that over Poncelet 3-periodics interscribed in (i) the homothetic pair, or (ii) the concentric pair with circumcircle, the sum of power circle areas is invariant, i.e., the sum of squared median lengths.

Recall both families conserve the sum of squared sidelengths (case [b] also conserves area). 

Update: Mark Helman says the sum of squared medians (squared power circle radii) is 3/4 the sum of squared sidelenghts, which both families conserve.
