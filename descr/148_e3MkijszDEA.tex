The video shows a very curious observation. Erect regular hexagons Ha,Hb, Hc on the sides of a triangle T=ABC and consider the 3 flank triangles Fa,Fb,Fc between them 

1) Let Th have vertices at the centroids of the hexagons. Th is perpsective with T at X13. The circumcenter Th is X627.
2) Let Tf have vertices at the X15 of the flanks. Tf is perpsective with T at X6. The circumcenter of Tf is (to be determined)
3) The 3 X16's of the Tf coincide at a single point!
