We explore the 3-point chord iteration in a circle centered at C. Let O1,O2,O3 be the 3 points in its interior. Fix O2,O3. The locus of O1 such that you close:

a) N=6 is the O2O3 line. This works for any integral multiple of 6.
b) N=9 is an ellipse 
c) N=12 is the union of (a) with an ellipse.
d) N=15 is the union of two ellipses
e) N=18 union of (a), (b), and a third ellipse
f) etc.

All elliptic loci are internally tangent to the circle at the intersections of O2O3 w the circle. Their major axes are parallle to O2O3 and their minor axes are along the perpendiculars from C onto O2O3.
