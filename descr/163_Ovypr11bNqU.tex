The outer Apollonius' circle C of a triangle is tangent to and encompasses the excircles. Its center is X(970) and the radius is (r^2+s^2)/(4r), where r is ithe inradius of T and s its semiperimeter [1,2].

The video studies C of the anticomplementary triangle (ACT) of an N=3 bicentric (poristic) family of Poncelet triangles [3].

Over the family (i) X(10) of the ACT is stationary, (ii) the locus of its vertices is a pseudo Pascal Lima√ßon, and (iii) the locus of X(970) of the ACT is a segment collinear with X(1) and X(3) of the bicentric family. Note that the radius of C is not stable.

Note: X(970) of the ACT is X(10441) of the reference [4, Part 6]. So we are showing that over the poristic family the locus of this center is a segment on the OI axis.
