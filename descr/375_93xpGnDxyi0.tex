Show is a the family of type II self-intersected 8-periodics (blue) in the elliptic billiard (black). For type I, see [1] The major axis is vertical for better framing. 8-periodic segments are all tangent to an elliptic confocal caustic (brown, barely visible).

Also shown:

1) The "outer" polygon (green) whose sides are tangent to the billiard the vertices. The vertices of the outer poly are inscribed in an ellipse (dashed green). This is related to the Octagrammum Mysticum (Chapt. 5, Prop. 5.1)[2]. The product A.A' is invariant where A (resp. A') is the signed area of the 8-periodic (resp. outer). Also constant is the product of the outer's cosines.

2)  Also shown is the constant-perimeter inversive polygon (inversion wrt unit circle centered on the bottom focus). Also invariant are the sum of its cosines, and the product of its area by the 8-periodic's.
