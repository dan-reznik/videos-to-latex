Correction: the narration starts with "in the next video". I meant "in the previous video" [1]. 

Take a genetric triangle T=ABC, and a point M which defines the following 3 subtriangles Ti={MBC, MCA, MAB}. Let T' denote the triangle whose vertices are the orthocenters of the Ti.

We saw in a previous video [1] that Area(T')=Area(T) irrespective of M. Here we report on two other phenomena:

a) if M = orthocenter X4 of T, then T'=T (areas are automatically equal).
b) if M is anywhere on the circumcircle of T, then T' is a reflection of T, i.e., their perimeters are the same.
