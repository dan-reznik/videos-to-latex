Elliptic billiard (a/b=1.5) shown black as well as its family of triangular (N=3) orbits. The three extouchpoints (where excircles touch each side of the triangle) have been bound to both sweep the caustic (in opposite direction) and to be congruent with tangency points between each side and caustic. The locus of the Feuerbach point F (where incircle and 9-pt circle touch) also sweeps the confocal caustic, albeit in a direction opposite to the extouchpoints. Finally, the anticomplement of F (shown as F bar), which is twice a reflection of F about the baricenter, has been found to sweep the billiard.
