Left Column: Top (resp. bottom) graph: locus of tangents to confocals to external ellipse from boundary points located at 0° and 90°, (resp. 5° and 95°), shown in red (resp. blue).

Right Column: Top (resp. bottom) graph: locus of tangents to confocals to external ellipse from boundary points located at 45° and 135° (resp. 45° and - 45°), shown in red (resp. blue).

Bottom graph: boun n is an ellipse E with b=1 and a varying from 1 to 3. Also shown are two points on E's boundary at locations:
