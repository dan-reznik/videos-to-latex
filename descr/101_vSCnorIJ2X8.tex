Given a triangle ABC it will be associated with a unique circumellipse E which passes thru each of A,B,C, and is locally tangent (perpendicular) to the bisectors of A,B, and C. We call this the "circumbilliard", as ABC will be an N=3 orbit of E. Because we know the billiard will be centered on the triangle's Mittenpunkt X(9), another way to say this is: the circumbilliard is the circumellipse centered on X(9).

In the animation two vertices are fixed, and a third one moves along a sinusoidal curve. For each configuration the circumbilliard is shown, centered on M, the Mittenpunkt, as well as its axes' orientation.
