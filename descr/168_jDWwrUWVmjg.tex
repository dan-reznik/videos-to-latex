An a/b=1.5 elliptic billiard is shown with its family of N=3 (triangular) orbits.

LEFT: for each orbit the three Miquel circles are shown in red as computed with respect to the extouch points (which we know sweep the orbits' caustic). Also shown (red dot) is the locus of the concurrence point of these three circles, congruent with X(40), known as the Miquel Point. Notice its upright elliptic trajectory.

RIGHT: the excentral triangle (green) is shown for each orbit. The Miquel construction is now computed with respect to the orbits' vertices. Notice the sideways elliptic locus of the Miquel Point. This is identified with X(1) the incenter of the orbit.
