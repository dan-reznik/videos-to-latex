Consider the of excentral triangles (orange) to 3-periodics in the elliptic billiard (not shown). The former is inscribed in an ellipse (since the locus of billiard excenters is an ellipse). Consider its affine image (light blue) such that the outer ellipse is sent to a circle and the inner one (elliptic billiard) is sent to a concentric ellipse. 

It turns out both families have invariant and identical product of cosines.
