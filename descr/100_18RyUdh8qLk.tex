An elliptic billiard (a/b=1.5) is shown as well as its family of N=3 orbits. Also shown is the orbit's anticomplementary triangle T', the (non-elliptic locus of its vertices -- dashed blue), the latter's 9-point circle (pink, congruent w/ the orbits circumcircle), and its incircle (green). The latter's intouchpoints happen to be on the billiard itself. Also shown is the circumbilliard for T'. We have found this to be an axis-aligned ellipse (a 2x scaled version of the billiard) whose center (its mittenpunkt M') moves along an ellipse -- M' is the Gergonne Point X(7). Also shown are the Feuerbach point of the orbit (F) and that of T' (F bar).
