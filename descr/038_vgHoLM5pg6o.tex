Recall the cross-ratio of 4 collinear points A,B,C,D  = (AC)(BD)/((BC)(AD)) [1]. There are 24 ways to order the four points, but only 6 groups of 4 combinations each yield distinct results, though all interrelated by simple expressions, see [1].

The video introduces several (possibly known) invariants in the sum (and/or product) of cross ratios defined over 3 "diagonals" in Poncelet N-Periodics. We cover N=5,6,7,8.

Comments appreciated!
