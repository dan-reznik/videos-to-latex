Family of 3-periodic orbits in elliptic billiard. For every orbit, compute its orthocenter (orange dot), orthic triangle (defined by the feet of the three altitudes), and its incenter (green dot). The locus of the latter is mesmerizing: made up of 4 exact elliptical arcs arrange as a square, where the north and south arcs coincide with the billiard and the left and right coincide with the locus of the orbit's orthocenter.
