N=4 and N=5 orbit families are shown in two Elliptic Billiards with a/b=1.5. Their Tangential Polygon is shown (green). whose vertices are intersections of tangents to consecutive orbit's vertices.  Two phenomena are illustrated:

1) Generalized N=3 Mittenpunkt: (dashed red) lines drawn from each Tangential vertex through the corresponding sides' midpoints all concur at the Billiard Center

2) Generalized N=3 Extouchpoints: the feet of (dashed green) perpendiculars dropped from each tangential vertex to the corresponding side is congruent with the point of tangency of that side with the confocal caustic, i.e., the locus of these feet is the caustic.
