The family of 3-periodics (blue) is shown inscribed in an outer ellipse and circumscribed about a concentric unit circle. Also shown is the excentral triangle (green), which is also the anticevian triangle with respect to incenter, for this family stationary at the common center. Also shown is a circumellipse C1 (orange) centered on one of the excenters (a vertex of the excentral triangle). Over the family, C1's aspect ratio and area are variable.
