A black elliptic billiard (a/b=1.5) is shown as well as the family of its N=3 orbits (blue). The confocal caustic to all triangular orbits for this billiard is shown in dashed black. Also shown are 6 triangles derived from the orbit: the medial (red), orthic (orange), intouch (green), excentral (dashed blue), extouch (dashed green), anticomplementary (dashed red) and feuerbach (brown).
