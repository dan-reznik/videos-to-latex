The orthocenter and/or circumcenter of the family of 3-periodic orbits in elliptic billiards are known to be ellipses. If we use a parameter "s" from 0 to 1 to dislocate either point toward one of its altitude feet (orbit vertex, respectively), their ellipses deform into higher order curves.

Elliptic loci of the orthocenter (top) and circumcenter (bottom) for the family of 3-periodic orbits in an elliptic billiard is shown as solid curves. Dashed curves represent the convex combination of the former with one altidude's foot (respectively, a vertex). Notice how a perfectly elliptic locus deforms into one containing 3 windings, seemingly of 6th order.
