An elliptic billiard is shown (a/b=1.15) with its family of self-intersecting 5-periodic orbits (pentagram, blue). A reference sideways pentagram is also shown dotted, which was used to compute the confocal caustic (green ellipse). According to Poncelet's Porism, an orbit's edges will be tangent to this caustic. The orbit itself is computed by shooting a first ray from the (moving) red dot on the billiard's boundary so it grazes the caustic tangentially (a green dot is shown at the point of tangency); then multiple reflections are carried on to complete the closed orbit. 

Note: we are using a/b=1.15 because pentagrams tend to be too thin when a/b is "big", i.e., above 1.5.
