Given a 3-periodic T=Pi, i=1,2,3, elliptic billiard w axes a,b. Let P1(t) = [a cos(t), b sin(t) ], and X be a Triangle Center of T. Explicit expressions for P2(t) and P3(t) can be found here [1].

We define the "Evolute Triangle" of (T,Xi) by the instantaenous tangency points of P1(t)X_i, P2(t)X_i, P3(t)X_i to their common envelope [2]. These are shown in pink for i=1,3,5,20, for an a/b=1.45. We've found that for higher a/b some of the envelopes become too large and/or non-compact.

Note: the envelope of (T,X1) is the evolute of the billiard [3].
