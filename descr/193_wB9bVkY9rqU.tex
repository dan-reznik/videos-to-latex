Family of triangles P1P2P3 inscribed in an outer ellipse E (black), with sides P1P2 and P1P3 tangent to an inner confocal ellipse E' (brown) while the third side P2P3 (red) envelops an ellipse (dashed red) in the pencil of E and E'.

Left: E' (brown) is chosen such that the envelope of P_2 P_3 (red) is the point at the center of the system. Notice this is the caustic required for the $N=4$ trajectory (completed with dashed blue). In such a case, the aspect ratio of the elliptic locus of the excenters P_2' and P_3' (dark green) is the reciprocal of that of E (black).

Right: E' (brown) is the N=6 trajectory (completed with dashed blue). In such a case, the locus of P_2' and P_3' is the same circle.

Notice in both cases the locus of excenter P_1' (light green) and that of the incenter X_1 (dark green interior to \E') are non-conics.
