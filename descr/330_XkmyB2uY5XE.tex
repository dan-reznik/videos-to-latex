Video shows several dual-caustic Poncelet iterations, for N=4,6,8,10,12, and explores the phenomenon whereby certain configurations can closely maintain closure (distance of 10^-4 to 10^-5 of the circumradius between first and last vertex) over all starting P1, while others don't maintain it at all.
