Left and right: poristic triangle (blue) family [1,2] with fixed incircle (green) and circumcircle (purple) for R=1 (both) and r=0.3625 (left) and r=0.45 (right).  

Also shown are the excentral triangles (green), the circular locus of their vertices (excenters, orange), of radius 2R and centered on X40 [3]. Notice the Circumcircle to the poristics is the 9-point Circle of the Excentral. Shown also is the Medial Triangle (pink) of the Excentrals, defined by the midpoint of each of the latter's sides. 

The pedal triangle from any point on the Circumcircle is a line, known as the Simson Line [5]. The video shows that if this point is X100 (known to be on the Circumcircle), the pedal triangles to both the poristic (blue) and Excentral Medials (pink) are dynamically parallel to the X1X3 axis (vertical lines in the video).
