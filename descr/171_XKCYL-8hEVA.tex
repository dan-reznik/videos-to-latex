This video explores possible answers to the following question [1]: 

Concerning the vertical-horizontal “billiard”, if the curve (be it smooth or polygonal) has a vertical and a horizontal axes of symmetry, then the map is 4-periodic, a strong poristic property. For example, one may take a rhombus. What happens if one perturbs it a little? Are there shapes for which the map is periodic but with a different period?

As the video shows, N-periodics only emerge when the rhombus is sheared to eliminate its central axes of symmetry.
