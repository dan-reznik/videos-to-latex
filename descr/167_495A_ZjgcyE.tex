Consider all circles centered on the fixed blue circle shown and passing thru a point P (animated in the video along the x axis). Their envelope (outer curve) is Pascal's Limaçon [1].

Notice when P is inside, on, or outside the blue circle, the Limaçon is a smooth curve, a cardioid, or a curve with a loop, respectively.

A few sample circles are shown which reveal how the inifnite set tesselates  the region bounded by the curve.
