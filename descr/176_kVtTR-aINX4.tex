Extensions of a triangle sides (blue) are tangent to the 3 excircles (green) at 6 points (vertices of the purple 6-gon).

The conic (orange) which passes through any of 5 vertices also passes through the 6th [1].

In the video the phenomenon is animated over the 1d family of 3-periodics in the Elliptic Billiard (black), though this property is valid for any triangle.  It can be shown the caustic enveloped by pairs of tangents common to an Excircle (dashed purple) is a scaled-up version of the Billiard.

Notice the conic is a degenerate hyperbola (two lines) when the referece triangle is a right triangle. We don't yet understand what geometric conditions make the conic be an ellipse vs a hyperbola.

To do: draw the locus of the conic center.

Also shown: the excentral triangle (solid green), the elliptic locus of the excenters over 3-periodics (dashed green), the caustic (brown).
