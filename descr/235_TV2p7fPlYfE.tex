N=4,5,6,7 families of orbits in an a/b=1.5 elliptic billiard. A construction shown for each one which yields a stationary point: (i) draw the tangential polygon (green), and (2) from each of its vertices draw a line through the corresponding side's midpoint (dashed red). All such lines will meet at the billiard center.
