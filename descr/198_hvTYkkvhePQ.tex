Video explores an iteration of chords in a circle C passing through 3 points O1,O2,O3 in the interior, selected in round-robin fashion. In the video, O2=-O3, and O1 is free. It turns out an N=9 porism closes iff O1 is on a certain ellipse internally tangent to C, and that closure is maintained for all starting locations on C (exact porism).
