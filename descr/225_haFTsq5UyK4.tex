A confocal pair of ellipses is shown which admits a 1d family of Poncelet 3-periodics (since the pair is confocal these are known as "elliptic billiard" trajectories).

The video shows an interesting property: over this family, there are 4 individual triangle centers at fixed linear combinations of X2 and X3 such that (i) two of them sweep perpendicular segments, and (ii) the other two sweep circles.

Details for their construction to appear in an upcoming (2021) publication w M. Helman, D. Laurain, R. Garcia, and D. Reznik.
