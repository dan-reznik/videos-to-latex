The video illustrates a two-caustic pseudo-Poncelet porism involving an outer circle C and two internal caustics D1, D2, where D2 is a copy of D1 rigidly rotated about the center of C by 45 degrees. Their radii have been tuned so that the Poncelet transverse closes within 10 iterations. Surprisingly, we get a porism.

Note: closure is maintained within a fraction of 10^-4 to 10^-5 of the circumradius.
