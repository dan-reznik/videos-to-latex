In this video we investigate the 60 pascal associated with certain N=6 Poncelet families, namely, bicentrics, harmonics, and MacBeath. Some patterns do emerge, especially in the harmonic family. These have vertices at the inversions of the vertices a family of rotating equilaterals wrt fixed point. Their definition and basic properties are covered in (Section VI, pp. 205)[1].
