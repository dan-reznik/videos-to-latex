The pedals (resp. antipedals) of the Isodynamic Points X15,X16 (resp. Isogonic Points X13,X14) are known to be equilaterals. Their centers are X396,X395 (resp. X5463, X5464).

The "Homothetic" Poncelet family is a 1d family of triangles (blue) inscribed on a first ellipse E=(a,b) and circumscribed about a second on E'=(a/2, b/2).

Interestingly, over such a family not only are the loci of X13,X14,X15,X16 all circles, but the areas of the 4 equilaterals is invariant!

Furthermore the loci of X5463 and X4564 are identical to those of X13 and X14. The loci of X396 and X395 are ellipses interior to E (resp. E').
