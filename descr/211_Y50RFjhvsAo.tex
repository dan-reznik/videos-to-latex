Consider a family of triangles (blue) with two "base" vertices P1,P2 stationary a third one P3 which moves parallel to the base (dashed blue), at some distance y0.

The video shows the loci of the incenter X1, barycenter X2, circumcenter X3, orthocenter X4, and de Longchamps point X20. Over the above triangle family these execute an ellipse-like curve, a straight line, a vertical line, a down parabola, and an up parabola, respectively.

Notice the loci of X1,X2,X4,X20 all meet at a particular point.
