An elliptic billiard (a/b=1.5) is shown black. Also shown are the family of N=3 (triangular) orbits (blue) and their confocal caustic (green). The orbits' excenters move along an upright ellipse (dashed green). The perpendiculars dropped from each excenter to the corresponding side (green) are congruent with the points of orbit-caustic tangency. Interconnecting them produces a (red) triangle. The intersection points of excenter-to-foot-of-perpendicular lines concur at the Bevan point X(40); its locus is an upright (red) ellipse, similar to the billiard, whose (red) foci are shown on the y axis.
