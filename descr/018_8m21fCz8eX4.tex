This video supports our recent publication [1]. It shows the family of Poncelet-Jacobi bicentric polygons [2] and its two limiting points l1 and l2. It also shows the following three invariant perimeter families: 
a) the pedal polygon wrt l1, inscribed in a loopless Pascal Limaçon
b) the pedal polygon wrt l2, inscribed in a Pascal Limaçon which loops thru l2.
c) its polar image (N-periodics in the elliptic billiard with one focus on l1).
