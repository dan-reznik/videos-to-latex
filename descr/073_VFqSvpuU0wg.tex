Let H (blue) be a harmonic polygon (blue) , and let H' (red) be a new polygon with vertices at the inversions of those of H wrt to a circle centered on a point C. H' is also harmonic [1, Section VI].

The video shows two potentially new observations which are likely generalizations of [3, Thm 11], to harmonic polygons.

a) the isocurves of Brocard angle of H' are circles in the pencil of the circumcircle and Brocard circle of H, also known as the Schoute pencil [2,3]. 
b) if C is on the Brocard circle or on the radical axis of the pencil, then the Brocard angle of H' is equal to that of H.
