A family of 3-periodics (blue) is shown in the elliptic billiard (black). Also shown are 3 associated circum-hyperbolas (light blue, pink, orange). Each is tangent at two vertices to the internal bisector, and at a third vertex, tangent to the external bisector. In this sense each hyperbola is a "billiard" to the 3-periodic: it undergoes 2 "reflections" and one "refraction".
