On ETC X(187) denotes the midpoint of the isodynamic points X(15) and X(16). Let T=ABC be a reference triangle. Let T' have vertices at the inversions of A,B,C wrt to a circle. The video covers a few phenomena, including:

Obs 1: the locus of X(187) of T' is a circle.
Obs 2: if O is the X(187) of T, then said circle has zero radius, i.e., the X(187) of T' coincides with that of T.
