Shown are four Poncelet triangle families inscribed in an outer ellipse E with two sides (blue) tangent to an inner concentric, axis-parallel ellipse E'. In each case, E' is chosen so that the third side (red) passes (envelops) the center point. For such cases, the video shows the locus of the barycenter is a 1/3-sized copy of the outer ellipse.
