The video shows a few "new" properties of the self-intersecting family of 4-periodics (blue) in the elliptic billiard (black), tangent to a hyperbolic caustic (green). Besides constant perimeter and sum of cosines, this family has zero signed area. Furthermore:

1) Its vertices are concyclic (dashed purple circle) w/ the two foci! 

2) Therefore,  inverting its vertices wrt to any circle would produce collinear points. In the video, the "inversive polygon" (pink) is shown wrt to a unit circle centered on f1 (left focus). 

3) The inversive polygon intersects the elliptic billiard's major axis on a fixed point which corresponds to the inversion of f2 (right focus) wrt to said inversion circle.
