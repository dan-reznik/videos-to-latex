An a/b=1.5 elliptic billiard is shown as well as its family of 3-periodic trajectories. The billiard is reflected at every bounce point so that the entire trajectory is shown as a (constant lenght L) straight line P1 to P1''. Here the starting vertex P1 is pinned to the origin. Since L is constant, the locus of the endpoint P1'' is a circle. Loci are drawn for intermediate trajectory vertices.
