Consider the affine image of a family of equilateral triangles rotating in a unit circle. These can also be regarded as a  family of Poncelet 3-periodics (blue) in the homothetic pai pair (black and brown). Let Pi, i=1,..,N denote its vertices. Here N=3.

Define the generalized evolute polygon (GEP) as having vertices at:

Pi' = Pi + s ri ni, where ri is the radius of curvature at Pi, ni is the inward-pointing normal at Pi, and s is a fixed scalar of choice.

Claim: for any s, and over the family, the area of the GEP is constant. In fact this is holds for all N greater than 2.

Furthermore, one can select two values "s" for which the area of the N=3 GEP is zero; in each case, the GEP collapses to a segment parallel to either major or minor axes, see [1].

The video also shows that the vertices is a 3-region pseudo-lemniscate (dashed pink).
