Top left: one triangle T=P1 P2 P3 in the poristic family with fixed circumcircle C (black) and incircle C' (brown).

Top right: the radius of  C' is reduced and only two sides of T remain tangent to C'. The third side (dashed blue) envelops a third circle C" (dashed red) which is on the pencil of C and C'. The incenter X1 is shown at its current position.

Bottom left: the radius of C' is now increased beyond so that the envelope of the third side (dashed red) is interior to C'.

Bottom right: at a special choice for the radius of C' the envelope collapses to a limiting point l1 of the C,C' pair. The radical axis (vertical dashed gray) of the pair is also shown, perpendicular to and passing through the midpoint of segment l1 l2.
