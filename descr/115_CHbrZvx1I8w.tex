This phenomenon is described in [5].

Left and right: a/b=1.5 Elliptic Billiard (black), family of 3-periodics (blue), and excentral triangles (green).

Left: X(3)-centered inconic [1] to the Excentral Triangle (red). Its Brianchon Point (perspector) is X(69). In terms of the reference 3-periodics these are X(40) and X(2951) [2].

Right: the X(5)-centered (MacBeath [3]) inconic of the Excentral Triangle (red). Its center, foci, and Brianchon are X(5), X(4), X(3), and X(264). In terms of the reference triangle these are: X(3), X(1), X(40), and X(1742) [4].

Soundtrack: Chopin, Nocturne Op 9, No 2.
