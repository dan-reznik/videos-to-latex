The video shows a Poncelet family of 5-gons (blue) inscribed in an outer circle (black) with sides tangent to a set of in-pencil circle (gold). The internal limiting point of the pencil is labeled "l1".

Also shown is the polar image (light blue) of the original family wrt circle centered on l1. This new family is interscribed in a set of confocal ellipses (dashed light blue) and has constant perimeter. It is a generalized billiard trajectory (elastic bounces everywhere).
