Let X be a triangle center of a triangle T. Let T' (resp T'')  be the inversive  (resp. polar) image of T wrt to a unit circle centered on a point P=(x,y). Let X' and (resp. X'') be triangle center X(k) of T' (resp. T'').

Every frame of the video shows isocurves of |X'-X| (left) and |X''-X| (right) for a particular k in the 1 to 200 range.
