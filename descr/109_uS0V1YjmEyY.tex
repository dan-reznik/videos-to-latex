Shown is the family of triangular orbits for an a/b=1.25 elliptic billiard. If you demand a hyperbola H pass through the Mittenpunkt X(9), the Incenter X(1), and the three excenters (shown green), H's center will fall squarely on X(100), the anticomplement of the Feuerbach point, which is always on the billiard. Furthermore, the asymptotes of H will be parallel to the billiard's.

Per Prof Igor Minevich, this hyperbola is the Jerabek Hyperbola of the Excentral Triangle.
