# Create LaTeX of List of Experimental Videos on YouTube.

R routines used to pull information from my collection of videos on Experimental Classical Geometry and convert them to a skeleton LaTeX file.

The list of videos comes from a spreadsheet, and information (description, publication date, thumbnail) is obtained with the YouTube API.

The output latex is called "main.tex"
